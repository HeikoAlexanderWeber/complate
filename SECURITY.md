## Vulnerability disclosure policy

Report to: [haw@voidpointergroup.com](mailto:haw@voidpointergroup.com)\
Make sure to encrypt your message! [*Click me for PGP public key*.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replicadse/replicadse/master/haw%40voidpointergroup.com.pgp)\
**Please respect the responsible disclosure principles.**\
Do **not** simply post a vulnerability publicly as issue. These will be deleted.\
**All** vulnerabilities will be posted and made public at some point _after_ the fix has been propagated. The exact time depends on the type of vulnerability and it's potential consequences.
