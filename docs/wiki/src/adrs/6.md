# ADR 6: Print command supporting STDIN pipe

## Summary

The print command MUST support piping the configuration into it via STDIN as alternative to the file based approach.\
The indicator for the pipe being used SHALL be the "-" character as argument to the pipe function.\
The configuration file ("-c", "--config") argument MUST NOT be compatible with the pipe argument. Either none, or exactly one of them MAY be explicitly specified at the same time.\
Since the config file argument has a default value, the pipe command overrides that so that the program behaves as if there was no configuration file specified at all.
